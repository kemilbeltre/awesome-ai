## Introduction

This repository is a collection of awesome projects and resources related to AI. It's actually a personal
list of things that I think are interesting either for everyday use or for specific areas.

## General purpose

## Software Development

- [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) - Trained on billions of lines of code, GitHub Copilot turns natural language
  prompts into coding suggestions across dozens of languages.
- [Cody](https://sourcegraph.com/cody) - Cody is a coding AI assistant that uses AI and a deep understanding of your codebase to help you write and understand code faster.

### Frontend

- [v0](https://v0.dev/) - v0 is a generative user interface system by Vercel powered by AI. It generates copy-and-paste friendly React
  code based on shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS that people can use in their projects.
